# Coding-contest-proof

Participated in 2 inter-school coding contests, based on python programming in my 12th class.
Attached the screenshots for proof.
Although our team did not win, but we learnt a lot in the process of timed contest, like how to think and build the algorithm, write and structure the code, satisfy the test cases. 
It was my first experience at competitive coding.
